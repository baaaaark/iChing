        <p> Welcome to your I Ching fortune!  If you are curious more can be learned about this ancient text at the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching">iChing Wikipedia article</a>  or  
            <a href="https://divination.com/how-to-consult-the-i-ching/">divination.com's iChing page</a>
            Many wise elders, sages, and noblemen have disagreed on whether the I Ching is a powerful oracle of fate or merely an entertaining game of 
            probability.  Ultimately it is best to see what what you think it is for yourself! 
            To consult the I Ching, clear your mind for a moment and try to think about a question or situation that is important to you, and type
            it out below.  Please clear your mind for a moment and see what comes to your mind.  This is the most important part of the whole 
            process.

            The I Ching will use a flip of three coins per line to determine what goes on each line of your Hexagram.  There are six lines in each
            Hexagram and both are customarily filled in from the bottom to the top.  The left Hexagram represents our present and the second our 
            change or future.  To visualize, let's pretend each line is a coin-flip Yin Yang: 
        <p>
            Two tails and a head will result in a - - Yang unchanged to a future - - Yang. (Black part of Yin Yang) <br>
            Two heads and a tail will result in a --- Yin unchanged to a future  --- Yin. (White part of Yin Yang) <br>
            Three tails will result in a present  - - Yin changing to a future   --- Yang (The black dot in the white part of the Yin Yang). <br>
            Three heads will result in a present  --- Yang changing to a future  - - Yin (The white dot in the black part of the Yin Yang). <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            If this is confusing, that's because it kind of is!  Thankfully we don't actually need to know any of this as the computer will do it 
            for us.  Whenever you are ready just press Enter and the computer will flip your coins and compile your Hexagram for you (it will start 
            to make sense as we progress.

        <p> Remeber to keep your question in mind when reading your hexagram(s).  Also as an ancient text there are many translations of each Hexagram,
            so a Google search with alternate translation may provide additional insight.
