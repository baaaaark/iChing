This is an iChing oracle app.  It is an ancient oracle that uses an extremely primitive form of binary to determine a person's fate.
There are 64 potential outcomes, determined by flipping three coins a total of six times.

The current system uses a three-dimensional array to store the information.  Future versions will include text translations on the
page itself, and some CSS styling/animation.  Any questions can be directed to Jason Oliver at baaaaark@gmail.com
